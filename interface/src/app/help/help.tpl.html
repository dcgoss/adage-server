    <h3><u>Genes</u></h3>
    ADAGE model is built with genes in <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PAO1
    strain. Information about genes are obtained from
    <a href="ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/DATA/GENE_INFO/Archaea_Bacteria/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.gene_info.gz"
    target="_blank">NCBI</a>.

    <h3><u>Samples</u></h3>
    We include samples measured on the Affymetrix Pseudomonas aeruginosa Array
    "Pae_G1a" (labeled as A-AFFY-30 in ArrayExpress database).

  <div class="lead" id="Experiments">
    <h3><u>Experiments</u></h3>
    Experiments are obtained from the ArrayExpress database. Each experiment
    has a “E-XXXX-number” accession number defined by ArrayExpress.

    <h3><u>Expression compendium?</u></h3>
    The webserver is currently using P.a. expression compendium. It was built
    on July 31 2015 and contains 125 datasets with 1051 individual samples.

  <div class="lead" id="Nodes">
    <h3><u>Nodes</u></h3>
    Nodes are building units in an ADAGE model. Each node is defined by a
    weight vector storing weight value of each gene in that node.

  <div class="lead" id="Signatures">
    <h3><u>Signatures</u></h3>
    Signatures are functional gene sets extracted by an ADAGE model. A
    signature contains genes contributing extremely positive high or
    negative high weights to a specific node. One node results in two
    signatures on positive and negative sides. The positive and negative
    signatures are treated independently.
