<h4>
    The ADAGE webserver allows users without programming expertise to analyze
    signatures extracted from large compendia of gene expression data via
    unsupervised machine learning methods. We primarily designed the server to
    support models constructed by
    <a href="http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00025-15">ADAGE</a>
    and
    <a href="http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/10/078659">eADAGE</a>;
    however, the server was designed to be general and can be used for other
    types of machine learning models as well.

    If you use the server for any type of model, please cite the
    [ADAGE Signature Analysis paper](Link TBD). Please also cite the paper that
    reports the machine learning model that you use.
