    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      ADAGE (or eADAGE) models are neural networks trained in an unsupervised
      manner on large publically available gene expression compendia. ADAGE
      aims at building essential features that can reconstruct a compendium.
      We derived gene expression signatures from ADAGE neural network nodes
      and found that these signatures resemble human-annotated biological
      pathways and cover many existing pathways [1,2]. In addition to
      signatures that match known pathways, ADAGE also extracts signatures
      that may group genes in novel data-driven ways.

    <h2>ADAGE signature analysis</h2>
    <p>
      Signatures are gene sets derived from an ADAGE model. They are formed
      because their genes are expressed coordinately in some samples in the
      compendium. An ADAGE signature analysis aims to identify signatures in
      which the expression of constiuent genes are altered by an experimental
      treatment. Such signatures may represent biological processes that are
      perturbed by the treatment.
